# Customer-Churn-Classification
💡 Customer Churn Classification Project
📋 Problem Statement
This project focuses on solving a Customer Churn Classification problem using machine learning techniques. The goal is to predict whether a customer will churn (leave) or stay, based on various features in the provided dataset.

Customer churn prediction is a vital business problem — especially for subscription-based services, telecom companies, and banks — because retaining existing customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones.

🔍 Objective
Input: A dataset containing customer information and their churn status.

Output: Predict whether a customer will churn or stay.

Goal: Train a classification model, evaluate it using key metrics, and visualize the performance using a confusion matrix heatmap.

⚙️ Approach
Data Preprocessing:

Load the CSV file.

Clean and preprocess data (handle nulls, encode labels).

Model Building:

Use Logistic Regression as a baseline classifier.

Train the model using a train-test split strategy.

Evaluation:

Generate and visualize a Confusion Matrix.

Calculate key performance metrics:

Accuracy

Precision

Recall

📈 Tools and Libraries
Python

Pandas

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Google Colab

📊 Expected Output
Confusion Matrix Heatmap

Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores printed.

A model capable of classifying churn status based on input features.
